# Game and Program Description
This program is used to create a simple Pong Game that is easy to play for all users. 

The game itself is a typical Pong Game. The user and the opponent have to use a paddle to face off against each other to see who can get
the most points from playing the game. Whoever gets the most points wins then game.

# Controls 
The controls for the game are fairly straightforward, with the Up and Down buttons used to move the paddle(s) while you are playing the 
game. 

# Steps to Compile and Run The Game
1. Before making the project, create an outline that showcases what the project should look like before coding it
2. Work on your code to start creating the project
3. Before compiling the code, try to fix any noticable errors that are visible in the code
4. Make sure that the code is tested out to check if there are no glitches, bugs, or any other technical difficulties while it is running
5. After the code is tested out/fixed, the user can start playing the game
6. If the user does not want to play the game anymore, have them exit the program so they can stop playing the game.
